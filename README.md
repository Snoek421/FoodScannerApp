# Food Scanner Android Application
This project was created as a starting version of an idea I had for a personal tool.
I have gluten intolerance and it is a lot of effort to read through the ingredients of every new thing that I buy to check if there is anything containing gluten. I had the thought "I wish I could just scan the ingredients with my phone to check".
I tried existing android apps but my phone would crash when using them, so for my final project of a second year mobile applications programming course, I worked on creating this app. The intention was to let a user take a picture of an ingredients label, use OCR to read the ingredients into a string, then compare that against a list of ingredients that contain gluten.
I could not get the OCR working in the time I had to create the project, but the rest of the functionality is there (along with some bugs).

## Instructions to compile
1. hold on, I'm finding and remembering them...

## License Choice
I selected a BSD 3-Clause License for this project, because it is simple but effective and covers all the things I think should be neccessary for this simple of a project.
Redistribution of the source code or binary compiled code must include my copyright notice, which to my understanding should prevent other students or programmers from having permission to take my code and present it as their own, whether that be in an assignment or as a standalone project. Because this was a simple project made for an assignment, my main concern for this code would be other studens finding and copying my work while I'm still in college and getting an academic offense because somebody copied and submitted it as their own. That being said, I have no issue with people taking and using this code because it is nothing special to me and is laregly simple basic functionality. 
This license seemed to allow those permissions while preventing others from "stealing" my work, so it fit the project's needs.
